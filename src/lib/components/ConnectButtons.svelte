<!--
 @component
 This component holds the buttons and logic for our signup/login/logout
 functionality. We're keeping the button UI and function logic in the same file
 for the sake of simplicity. This component is then imported and used in the
 `$lib/components/ui/Header.svelte` component, which in turn is placed on the
 page in the `/src/routes/+layout.svelte` file.

 In its bare state, all the buttons will always show, and there's no actual
 logging in, signing up, etc. taking place. We've also not pre-coded any way to
 _store_ the passkey ID or smart wallet address, once it is known. Perhaps for
 that, you'll use a database, or localStorage, or something else entirely. It's
 up to _you_ to provide the functionality you want to see here, this component
 is merely a canvas for you to paint on.

 We do provide some toast logic for informing users of errors, but you can
 modify/delete that as you see fit.

    // error _handling_, though. So, use whatever techniques you see fit.
